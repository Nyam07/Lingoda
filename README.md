# Lingoda
This is a web automation project that gets data from an excel file and uses it to register to the Lingoda website. 
It uses Selenium library to perform the automation.

The files labeled with 2 at the end skip the first page of the website to ensure the bot works well.

The file *Lingoda_account_creation* is only responsible for creating the user accounts using the data in the excel sheet.
The file *Lingoda_booking* creates accounts and also books a customized english class on the website.
